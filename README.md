# 3.5 Years of a Relationship, in Whatsapp messages
This repo contains the code I used to produce the graphs and analysis contained in an article I wrote, [published in Data Slice publication on Medium.](https://medium.com/data-slice/3-5-years-of-a-relationship-in-whatsapp-messages-4f4c95073c9d)

I have added the option to enter relevant names at the top of script.R to allow other people to analyse their own chats. I have not tested this in any way and cannot guarantee it will work for all people. I obtained the "_chat.txt" file by taking the following steps:
* Open the chat you wish to analyse in Whatsapp
* Open the menu for that chat (for me this was by clicking the name of the other participant)
* Scroll down to 'Export chat', below 'Share Contact' and above 'Clear Chat'
* Export as a zip file without media, send to my laptop and unzip
    
As I say, I have not tested this with other files. I am using iOS 13.3.1 and it is possible that other operating systems or versions of Whatsapp will export the data in a slightly different format, but in that case this repo can still be used a starting point.
